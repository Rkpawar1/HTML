 The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
 It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator,
 it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.
 It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, 
 requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.
 Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years,
 then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

 The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, 
 and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century, 
 tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia,
 the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China.<br> Today, the tiger's range is fragmented,
 stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, 
 Indochina and Sumatra.

 Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. 
 They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time,
 and were the first animals ever to be domesticated. ...
 Sometimes people also use "dog" to describe other canids, such as wolves.
 Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work.<br>
 They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. 
 Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets.[5] Dogs eat both meat and vegetables, 
 often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food. 
 Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, fire dogs,
 messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs.

 <p>
 They are sometimes called "canines" from the Latin word for dog - canis.
 Sometimes people also use "dog" to describe other canids, such as wolves. 
 A baby dog is called a pup or puppy. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old.[6]
